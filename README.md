# FallingCylinder
Experiment to find highest timestep for various falling cylinder configurations<br /><br />
Execute with "moby-driver -r -p=./build/cylinder-drop.so cylinder.xml"<br /><br />
Data for energy of the rod is in EnergyData, ran for timesteps of 0.001,0.01,0.1,0.5, and 1.0<br /><br />
Data for linear and angular positions in Success/ folder, the ones that failed because of the rod going to infinity are in Failure/ folder <br /><br />
Try out gearing with a robotic arm in pendulum-gears.xml in Moby/example<br /><br />
Look at the sdf format under the Gazebo webpage<br /><br />
**NOTE** dependencies on the Positronics Lab code Moby and Ravelin also found on Github
